# Syria Tree Cover Loss (2000 - 2021)

## The Data

The [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) is an online platform for monitoring changes in global forest cover. Its tree coverage data are sourced from a [University of Maryland time-series analysis of Landsat images](http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.7.html) that show global forest extent and change. These data can be downloaded for free, as .tiff files.

Following are example of what these files look like rendered using QGIS, in Syria, covering the period from 2000-2020. The intensity of the red color is commensurate with the intensity of forest cover loss. The basemaps sourced from Google terrain maps.

## Findings

From 2000 to 2021, Syria has lost 26,576 hectares of forest cover, with loss begining to escalate in  2011. The following line chart shows the pace of tree cover loss over this period.

The table, below, shows the three governorates responsible for more than 90% of the country's tree cover loss: Lattakia, Hamah, and Idlib.

| Governorate | Tree Cover Loss (ha) | Percent National Total |
| ----------- | --------------------:| ----------------------:|
| Lattakia    | 14,045               | 53%                    |
| Hamah       | 7,524                | 28%                    |
| Idlib       | 2,630                | 10%                    |
