# Seaborn Trade Activity Estimation

## June 2023 Updates

Firstly, we update our estimates of trade activity, with AIS (Automatic Identification System) data up to June 1st, 2023. We apply the same methodology described in our earlier [documentation notes](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor/notebooks/ais-analysis/README.html).

### Unique Vessels in Turkey and Syria

Additionally, we assessed the impact of the February earthquake, by looking at daily counts of unique vessels in selected ports that are geographically close to the epicenter.
