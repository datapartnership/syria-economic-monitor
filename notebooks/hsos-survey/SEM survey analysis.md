# Humanitarian Assistance Survey Data


## Data

We use data from the Humanitarian Situation Overview Survey (HSOS) conducted by REACH. REACH is a joint initiative of IMPACT Initiatives, ACTED and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research - Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNITAR-UNOSAT). The HSOS is collected monthly in Northeast Syria (NES) and Northwest Syria (NWS). The survey uses key informant interviews to collect data at the community (admin4) level. The panel used for the analysis includes 1,426 communities (371 in NWS and 1246 in NES) which are included in all rounds of data collection.

The HSOS includes information on community situations and needs relating to shelter, electricity, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food security, livelihoods, health, education, humanitarian assistance, and priority needs. HSOS has disaggregated information on the different conditions and needs of residents and internally displaced persons (IDPs).


## Methodology

In the analysis, we look at trends in the data before and after the earthquake, and whether those trends differ depending on severity of exposure to the earthquake. We use data from December 2022 as the most recent data before the earthquake and April 2023 as the first dataset after the earthquake. Note that we do not include data from January 2023 as it was collected for NWS only, and we do not include data from February 2023 as it was collected during the time of the earthquake.

We compare outcomes for communities severely impacted by the earthquake before/after the earthquake compared to communities moderately affected or lightly affected. We additionally compare the trends observed before/after the earthquake to the trends for the same three subsets of communities over the same period of time one year earlier. Specifically, we measure trends from December 2022 to March/April 2023, and compare those to trends from December 2021 to March/April 2022.

The earthquake exposure measure uses the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (mmi). From this we derive three groups of communities: light earthquake intensity, moderate intensity, and strong or very strong intensity.


## Implementation

Code to replicate the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/syria-economic-monitor/tree/main/notebooks/hsos-survey/notebooks/hsos-survey/Do%20Files/).
The [main script](https://github.com/datapartnership/syria-economic-monitor/tree/main/notebooks/hsos-survey/notebooks/hsos-survey/Do%20Files/HSOS%20SEM%20-%20Master%20do%20file.do) loads all packages and runs all scripts for the analysis.
The script to produce the graphs can be found [here](https://github.com/datapartnership/syria-economic-monitor/tree/main/notebooks/hsos-survey/notebooks/hsos-survey/Do%20Files/4_Bar%Graphs.do).

## Findings

### Humanitarian Assistance
Communities strongly affected by the earthquake (in Northwest Syria) were
more likely to receive humanitarian assistance than communities that were
less affected (in Northeast Syria), both before and after the earthquake.
Approximately 80% of the communities that were strongly affected by the
earthquake were already receiving humanitarian assistance prior to the
earthquake. As Figure 1 shows, by March 2023 access to humanitarian aid
increased for the resident population but remained comparable to
pre-earthquake levels for the internally displaced population (IDPs).

The data suggests that increases for residents were short-lived;
by April 2023 access to aid was comparable to pre-earthquake levels
for both populations. There is a notable change in composition of aid
post-earthquake: cash and food vouchers increase significantly immediately
after the earthquake as shown in Figures 2 and 3.
By April, cash assistance had returned to pre-earthquake level but
provision of food vouchers remained higher than it was in the
pre-earthquake period.
For residents, these changes contribute to an overall increase in
humanitarian assistance.
For IDPs, increases in cash and food were offset by decreases in
direct food aid and water and sanitation services.

### Access to Services
Access to community electricity networks was substantially lower for
communities in NWS strongly affected by the earthquake than communities
that were less affected (in NES). Immediately after the earthquake,
access to electricity increases substantially in the strongly affected
communities but does not change in communities lightly or moderately
affected, as shown in Figure 4. These new connections translate directly
into improved access for households: in strongly affected communities,
the proportion of communities reporting less than 8 hours of electricity
per day drops from two-thirds (pre-earthquake) to less than half
(post-earthquake). Access to food markets, health services and education
is not noticeably affected by the earthquake.
Communities strongly affected by the earthquake had more access to
food markets and health services prior to the earthquake and there is
no significant change in trend observed after the earthquake.
Nearly all communities in the sample had access to education services
prior to the earthquake and there is no noticeable effect of the earthquake.

### Priority Needs & Coping Strategies
In the post-earthquake period, the primary needs for the IDP population
are food, shelter, and livelihood support. For residents, the top priority
needs are food, livelihoods support and water and sanitation services.
In communities strongly affected by the earthquake, food and shelter
needs are particularly pronounced; these needs were already higher in
the pre-earthquake period and the gap increases in the period after the
earthquake, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. One-third of the strongly
affected communities report that food is the top priority need for IDPs,
compared to only about 1 in 10 of the less-affected communities.
Residents in communities strongly affected by the earthquake also
reported a significant increase in food needs directly after the earthquake.
 By April, residentsâ€™ demand for food had dropped, which is consistent
 with the significant increase in food aid observed in the same communities.
 Demand for shelter increased for residents and IDPs immediately after the
 earthquake; April data suggests that residents shelter needs are
 increasingly being met whereas shelter remains an important priority
 for IDPs.

</p>

In terms of coping strategies, IDPs and residents both
increases sales of household items and productive assets in communities
strongly affected by the earthquake. Somewhat surprisingly, there are
substantial decreases in reports of sending children to work or to
early marriage for both residents and IDPs, possibly due to humanitarian
interventions.

## Limitations
The categorical definition of exposure to the earthquake: light, moderate, or strong intensity is highly geographically correlated within the HSOS sample. Of the 346 communities in NWS, 331 were affected strongly by the earthquake and the remaining 15 were affected moderately. In NES, in contrast, only 45 communities were strongly affected, 625 were moderately affected, and 410 were lightly affected. This is to say, nearly all strongly affected communities are in NWS and all lightly affected communities are in NES. NES and NWS differ in important observable and unobservable ways - such as the controlling regime, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.


## Next Steps
Given the limited variation in the measure of earthquake intensity, the first next step will be to explore distance from the epicenter as a more continuous measure which may be less correlated with other underlying conditions (such as soil characteristics). If we are able to establish parallel trends prior to the earthquake, a difference-in-difference strategy would be appropriate.
Longer-term, a larger survey sample, ideally nationally-representative  would all for more robust analysis.
