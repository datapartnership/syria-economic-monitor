# Mobility Data

In this pilot study, we leverage mobility data to estimate trade activity (tentatively both formal and informal) and provide insights in the aftermath of the earthquakes near [Nurdağı, Türkiye](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/m78-and-m75-kahramanmaras-earthquake-sequence-near-nurdagi-turkey-turkiye) on February 6, 2023.

## Data Availability Statement

Data are available upon request through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). Licensing and access information for all other datasets are included in the documentation.

## Limitations

```{caution}
The mobility data represents a subset of the total population in an area, specifically only users that turned on the Location Services device setting on their mobile device. This is not the total population density.
