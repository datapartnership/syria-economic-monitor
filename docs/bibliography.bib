              governments to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus has
              resulted in large impacts to the global economy. Here, we derive
              a new high-frequency indicator of economic activity using
              empirical vessel tracking data, and use it to estimate the global
              maritime trade losses during the first eight months of the
              pandemic. We go on to use this high-frequency dataset to infer
              the effect of individual non-pharmaceutical interventions on
              maritime exports, which we use as a proxy of economic activity.
              Our results show widespread port-level trade losses, with the
              largest absolute losses found for ports in China, the Middle-East
              and Western Europe, associated with the collapse of specific
              supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total, we
              estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0\% to -9.6\%
              during the first eight months of 2020, which is equal to around
              206-286 million tonnes in volume losses and up to 225-412 billion
              USD in value losses. We find large sectoral and geographical
              disparities in impacts. Manufacturing sectors are hit hardest,
              with losses up to 11.8\%, whilst some small islands developing
              states and low-income economies suffered the largest relative
              trade losses. Moreover, we find a clear negative impact of
              COVID-19 related school and public transport closures on
              country-wide exports. Overall, we show how real-time indicators
              of economic activity can inform policy-makers about the impacts
              of individual policies on the economy, and can support economic
              recovery efforts by allocating funds to the hardest hit economies

This study was undertaken at the Census Agriculture Region (CAR) and the Rural Municipality (RM) of the province of Saskatchewan, in three prairie agro-climate zones. We compared MODIS-derived vegetation indices, gross primary productivity (GPP), and net primary productivity (NPP) to the known yields for barley, canola, and spring wheat. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the relationships between the metrics and yield at the CAR and RM levels for the years 2000 to 2016. Models were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) approach. Results showed that vegetation indices at crop peak growing stages were better predictors of yield than GPP or NPP, and EVI2 was better than NDVI. Using seasonal maximum EVI2, CAR-level crop yields can be estimated with a relative root-mean-square-error (RRMSE) of 14-20\% and a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.53-0.70, though the exact relationship varies by crop type and agro-climate zone. LOOCV showed the stability of the models across different years, although interannual fluctuations of estimation accuracy were observed. Assessments using RM-level yields showed slightly reduced accuracy, with NSE of 0.37-0.66, and RRMSE of 18-28\%. The best performing models were used to map annual crop yields at the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) polygon level. The results indicated that the models could perform well at both spatial scales, and thus, could be used to disaggregate coarse resolution crop yields to finer spatial resolutions using MODIS data.},

              Crop yield prediction before harvest is a key issue in managing agricultural policies and making the best decisions for the future. Using remote sensing techniques in yield estimation studies is one of the important steps for many countries to reach their agricultural targets. However, crop yield estimates rely on labor-intensive surveys in Ethiopia. To solve this, we used Sentinel-2, crop canopy analyzer, and ground-truthing data to estimate grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass (AGB) of two major crops, teff and finger millet, in 2020 and 2021 in Ethiopia’s Aba Gerima catchment. We performed a supervised classification of October Sentinel-2 images at the tillering stage. Among vegetation indices and leaf area index (LAI) used to predict teff and finger millet GY and AGB, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized-difference VI (NDVI) provided the best fit to the data. NDVI and EVI most influenced teff AGB (
              R
              2
              = 0.87; RMSE = 0.50 ton/ha) and GY (
              R
              2
              = 0.84; RMSE = 0.14 ton/ha), and NDVI most influenced finger millet AGB (
              R
              2
              = 0.87; RMSE = 0.98 ton/ha) and GY (
              R
              2
              = 0.87; RMSE = 0.22 ton/ha). We found a close association between GY and AGB and the satellite EVI and NDVI. This demonstrates that satellite images can be employed in yield prediction studies. Our results show that satellite and crop canopy analyzer-based monitoring can facilitate the management of teff and finger millet to achieve high yields and more sustainable food production and environmental quality in the area. The results could be reproducible under similar study catchment conditions and boost crop yield. Extrapolation of the models to other areas requires local validation. To improve crop monitoring for farmers and reduce expenses, we suggest integrating time series Sentinel-2 images along with LAI obtained from crop canopy analyzers collected during the cropping season.},

	abstract = {Developing countries often have poor monitoring and reporting of weather and crop health, leading to slow responses to droughts and food shortages. Here, I develop satellite analysis methods and software tools to predict crop yields two to four months before the harvest. This method measures relative vegetation health based on pixel-level monthly anomalies of NDVI, EVI and NDWI indices. Because no crop mask, tuning, or subnational ground truth data are required, this method can be applied to any location, crop, or climate, making it ideal for African countries with small fields and poor ground observations. Testing began in Illinois where there is reliable county-level crop data. Correlations were computed between corn, soybean, and sorghum yields and monthly vegetation health anomalies for every county and year. A multivariate regression using every index and month (up to 1600 values) produced a correlation of 0.86 with corn, 0.74 for soybeans, and 0.65 for sorghum, all with p-values less than     10  − 6     . The high correlations in Illinois show that this model has good forecasting skill for crop yields. Next, the method was applied to every country in Africa for each country’s main crops. Crop production was then predicted for the 2018 harvest and compared to actual production values. Twenty percent of the predictions had less than 2\% error, and 40\% had less than 5\% error. This method is unique because of its simplicity and versatility: it shows that a single user on a laptop computer can produce reasonable real-time estimates of crop yields across an entire continent.},

In this study, we explored Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices- and phenology-based yield prediction generalization model taking the US Corn Belt as an example. We calculated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) time series, which were adjusted using greenup dates derived from the Land Cover Dynamics product MCD12Q2. Based on the adjusted VI (NDVI, EVI2) time series, the VI change rate (dVI) time series was calculated, which represents crop growth rate. The first step was to cluster the adjusted VI and dVI time series, called ‘greenup groups’, according to corresponding greenup dates with a five-day interval. Then in different greenup groups, we constructed empirical univariate models with VI having the maximum correlation with crop yield, and multivariate models with VI and dVI, which were also used to construct the generalized model. After clustering, the days with maximum VI correlation gradually decreased as greenup days increasing, and the univariate VI model and multivariate VI and dVI model performances in different groups improved. The generalized models with specific VI and dVI variables in each group predicted yields of corn and soybean with R2 values mainly ranging from 0.55 to 0.75 and 0.55 to 0.70, while RMSE mainly ranging from 1000 to 1500 kg/ha and 300 to 400 kg/ha for both NDVI and EVI2 from 2008 to 2018 with leave-one-year-out cross-validation for all groups. The model using MODIS data was convenient and scalable with limited data requirements and date-determined variables after greenup, and offered a generalized method to predict crop yields at a large scale before harvest with good performance.},

Satellite-driven crop monitoring has become a main method to derive crop information at local, regional, and global scales by revealing the spatial and temporal dimensions of crop growth status and production. However, there is a lack of quantitative, objective, and robust methods to ensure the reliability of crop information, which reduces the applicability of crop monitoring and leads to uncertain and undesirable consequences. In this paper, we review recent progress in crop monitoring and identify the challenges and opportunities in future efforts. We find that satellite-derived metrics do not fully capture determinants of crop production and do not quantitatively interpret crop growth status; the latter can be advanced by integrating effective satellite-derived metrics and new onboard sensors. We have identified that ground data accessibility and the negative effects of knowledge-based analyses are two essential issues in crop monitoring that reduce the applicability of crop monitoring for decisions on food security. Crowdsourcing is one solution to overcome the restrictions of ground-truth data accessibility. We argue that user participation in the complete process of crop monitoring could improve the reliability of crop information. Encouraging users to obtain crop information from multiple sources could prevent unconscious biases. Finally, there is a need to avoid conflicts of interest in publishing publicly available crop information.},

	abstract = {Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential in the food industry’s decision-making process, where vegetation condition index (VCI) and thermal condition index (TCI) coupled with machine learning (ML) algorithms play crucial roles. The drawback, however, is that a one-fits-all prediction model is often employed over an entire region without considering subregional VCI and TCI’s spatial variability resulting from environmental and climatic factors. Furthermore, when using nonlinear ML, redundant VCI/TCI data present additional challenges that adversely affect the models’ output. This study proposes a framework that (i) employs higher-order spatial independent component analysis (sICA), and (ii), exploits a combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) and ML (i.e., PCA-ML combination) to deal with the two challenges in order to enhance crop yield prediction accuracy. The proposed framework consolidates common VCI/TCI spatial variability into their respective subregions, using Vietnam as an example. Compared to the one-fits-all approach, subregional rice yield forecasting models over Vietnam improved by an average level of 20\% up to 60\%. PCA-ML combination outperformed ML-only by an average of 18.5\% up to 45\%. The framework generates rice yield predictions 1 to 2 months ahead of the harvest with an average of 5\% error, displaying its reliability.},

	abstract = {As a result of the resolution of the armed military conflict on the territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the agricultural infrastructure of the latter was marked by large-scale destruction. Thousands of hectares of fields, the harvest from which previously provided both domestic and world needs, were mined, destroyed, damaged by artillery shelling, explosions and movements of military equipment. To restore the affected areas to ensure food security of Ukraine and the world, the state government, with the support of international organizations, must correctly distribute financial resources between affected landowners and farmers. For this, there is a need for accurate identification of war-affected territories. This task can be effectively performed using remote sensing data. In this work, damage to agricultural fields due to military operations is searched for by calculating the relative difference of the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 satellite data. Cloud-free composites of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are compared for the nearest period before and after active hostilities in a specific area (dates and locations are obtained from the ACLED source). Pixels whose relative difference exceeds a given threshold are considered damaged. The survey of the country's territories was conducted from February 24 to September 25, 2022, dividing the dates into biweekly periods. According to the results of the research, such damage to agricultural fields as craters from explosions and shelling, traces of machinery, burnt fields, etc., were found. The relative difference between the minimum and average values of vegetation indices in the affected areas averaged 25\% versus 15\% for the minimum period before and after the lesion. The detected damaged areas were validated using ACLED data. It was determined that more than 50\% of the total number of areas identified as damaged were located within a radius of up to 5 km from the zone of combat activities.},

Time-series two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was derived from the 8 day composite 250 m MODIS reflectance data from 2003 to 2016. Using a general cropland mask, the strongest positive linear correlation between crop yields and EVI2 was observed at the end of July to early August, whereas a negative correlation was observed in spring. Using crop-specific masks, the time of the strongest positive linear correlation for winter wheat was found between mid-May and early June, corresponding to peak growth stages of the crop. EVI2 derived at peak growth stages of a crop provided good predictive capability for grain yield estimation, with considerable inter-annual variation. A multiple linear regression model was established for county-level yield estimation using EVI2 at peak growth stages and the year as independent variables. The model accounted for the spatiotemporal variability of grain yields of about 30\% and 47\% for winter wheat, 63\% and 65\% for corn, and 59\% and 64\% for soybean using the general cropland mask and crop-specific masks, respectively. A negative correlation during the spring indicated that vegetation index extracted using a general cropland mask should be used with caution in regions with mixed crops, as factors other than the growth conditions of the targeted crops may also be captured by remote sensing data.},

A strong correlation was found between aus rice yield and VCI and VHI during the critical period of aus rice development that occurs during March-April (weeks 8–13 of the year), several months in advance of the rice harvest. Stepwise principal component regression (PCR) was used to construct a model to predict yield as a function of critical-period VHI. The model reduced the yield prediction error variance by 62\% compared with a prediction of average yield for each year.

However, the growth metrics derived from the MODIS NDVI or EVI have so far not been explored and applied to crop yield yet. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to design NDVI- and EVI-based crop growth metrics, which biometrically capture the status and trend of crop growth and thus could be more powerful for growth yield management. We developed 19 NDVI- and EVI-based growth metrics, respectively, to monitor crop growth and yield, which is based on a time series of MODIS Terra 16-day 250 m data product from 2000 to 2018. Among the NDVI- and EVI-based vegetation growth metrics (VGM), the maximum (VGMmax), the integrated (VGMinteg), the sum of green-up (VGMsumgrn), the 70 days growth stage (VGM70), 85 days growth stage (VGM85), and 98 days growth stage (VGM98), the sum of 85 days growth stage (VGM85total), and the sum of 98 days growth stage (VGM98total) are mentionable. In this study, we implemented these crop growth metrics for soybean crop yield modeling at Mississippi Delta, Mississippi, USA. Soybean is a major crop cultivated in this region that is consisted of a total of 18 counties with similar agricultural cropping patterns. We observed that NDVI- and EVI-based VGMmax, VGM70, VGM85, VGM98total fitted models best with R-Square about 0.95. Using cross-validation of 80\% train and 20\% test size, we found NDVI-based VGM85 (e.g., normalized mean prediction error (NMPE) = 0.034) and EVI-based VGMmax (NMPE = 0.033) were the best fit linear yield models for this region. Designing novel crop growth indices based on crop phenological and ecological characteristics, this study further showed NDVI- and EVI-based growth metrics for crop growth monitoring and yield modeling. These growth metrics can be applied to other types of crop monitoring in different climate zones.},

This study investigates general applicability of high temporal resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250m gridded vegetation product for monitoring rice crop growth, mapping rice crop acreage and analyzing crop yield, at the province-level. The MODIS 250m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series data, field data and crop calendar information were utilized in this research in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The following methodology was used: (1) data pre-processing and rice plant growth analysis using Vegetation Indices (VI) (2) extraction of rice acreage and start-of-season dates from VI time series data (3) accuracy assessment, and (4) yield analysis with MODIS VI. The results show a direct relationship between rice plant height and MODIS VI. The crop calendar information and the smoothed NDVI time series with Whittaker Smoother gave high rice acreage estimation (with 86\% area accuracy and 75\% classification accuracy). Point level yield analysis showed that the MODIS EVI is highly correlated with rice yield and yield prediction using maximum EVI in the rice cycle predicted yield with an average prediction error 4.2\%. This study shows the immense potential of MODIS gridded vegetation product for keeping an up-to-date Geographic Information System of rice cultivation.},

The approach adopts a hierarchical system covering four spatial levels of detail: global, regional, national (thirty-one key countries including China) and “sub-countries” (for the nine largest countries). The thirty-one countries encompass more that 80\% of both production and exports of maize, rice, soybean and wheat. The methodology resorts to climatic and remote sensing indicators at different scales. The global patterns of crop environmental growing conditions are first analyzed with indicators for rainfall, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as well as potential biomass. At the regional scale, the indicators pay more attention to crops and include Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Cropped Arable Land Fraction (CALF) as well as Cropping Intensity (CI). Together, they characterize crop situation, farming intensity and stress. CropWatch carries out detailed crop condition analyses at the national scale with a comprehensive array of variables and indicators. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), cropped areas and crop conditions are integrated to derive food production estimates. For the nine largest countries, CropWatch zooms into the sub-national units to acquire detailed information on crop condition and production by including new indicators (e.g., Crop type proportion). Based on trend analysis, CropWatch also issues crop production supply outlooks, covering both long-term variations and short-term dynamic changes in key food exporters and importers. The hierarchical approach adopted by CropWatch is the basis of the analyses of climatic and crop conditions assessments published in the quarterly “CropWatch bulletin” which provides accurate and timely information essential to food producers, traders and consumers.},

	abstract = {A large-area map of the spatial distribution of rice is important for grain yield estimations, water management and an understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. In this paper, we developed the Normalized Weighted Difference Water Index (NWDWI) for identifying the unique characteristics of rice during the flooding and transplanting period. With the aid of the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model and the phenological data observed at agrometeorological stations, the spatial distributions of single cropping rice and double cropping early and late rice in the Yangtze River Delta region were generated using the NWDWI and time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index data derived from MODIS/Terra data during the 2000–2010 period. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived rice planting area was validated against agricultural census data at the county level. The spatial accuracy was also tested based on a land use map and Landsat ETM+ data. The decision coefficients for county-level early and late rice were 0.560 and 0.619, respectively. The MODIS-derived area of late rice exhibited higher consistency with the census data during the 2000–2010 period. The algorithm could detect and monitor rice fields with different cropping patterns at the same site and is useful for generating spatial datasets of rice on a regional scale.},

	abstract = {Rice is one of the major crops cultivated predominantly in flooded paddies, thus a large amount of water is consumed during its growing season. Accurate paddy rice maps are therefore important inputs for improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration in the agricultural landscape. The main objective of this study was to obtain flooded paddy rice maps using multi-temporal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Krishna River Basin, India. First, ground-based spectral samples collected by a field spectroradiometer, CROPSCAN, were used to demonstrate unique contrasts between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) observed during the transplanting season of rice. The contrast between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) from MODIS time series data was then used to generate classification decision rules to map flooded rice paddies, for the transplanting seasons of Kharif and Rabi rice crops in the Krishna River Basin. Consistent with ground spectral observations, the relationship of the MODIS EVI vs. LSWI of paddy rice fields showed distinct features from other crops during the transplanting seasons. The MODIS-derived maps were validated against extensive reference data collected from multiple land use field surveys. The accuracy of the paddy rice maps, when determined using field plot data, was approximately 78\%. The MODIS-derived rice crop areas were also compared with the areas reported by Department of Agriculture (DOA), Government of India (Government Statistics). The estimated root mean square difference (RMSD) of rice area estimated using MODIS and those reported by the Department of Agriculture over 10 districts varied between 3.4\% and 6.6\% during 10 years of our study period. Some of the major factors responsible for this difference include high noise of the MODIS images during the prolonged monsoon seasons (typically June–October) and the coarse spatial resolution (500 m) of the MODIS images compared to the small crop fields in the basin. However, this study demonstrates, based on multi-year analysis, that MODIS images can still provide robust and consistent flooded paddy rice extent and areas over a highly heterogeneous large river basin.},
