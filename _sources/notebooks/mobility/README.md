# Population Movement Trends

This pilot study seeks to demonstrate the potential of mobility data as a powerful tool for estimating population movement trends and, particularly, in context of emergencies and data scarcity.

Understanding population movement trends is of paramount importance for various fields, including urban planning, disaster response, and public policy formulation. Traditional methods of data collection, such as census surveys and transportation studies, while valuable, often face limitations in terms of scale, timeliness, and granularity. Mobility data, sourced from mobile devices, GPS, and other location-based services, offers an alternative approach that can transcend these limitations. By analyzing anonymized and aggregated location data sample of individuals, we aim to uncover nuanced patterns of movement within urban and rural settings, and gauge the impact of external factors, such as public events or emergencies, on population mobility. It is paramount to emphrasize that this approach does not come with significant limitations, in particular, in terms of sample bias.

The objectives of this study are threefold:

- To assess the feasibility and accuracy of using mobility data for estimating population movement trends.
- To develop analytical methods and models that can extract meaningful insights from this data.
- To showcase the practical applications and relevance of such insights for informed decision-making in various domains.

## Data Availability Statement

## Limitations

```{warning}
- **Sample Bias:** The sampled population is composed of GPS-enabled devices drawn out from a longituginal mobility data panel. It is important to emphasize the sampled population is obtained via convenience sampling and that the mobility data panel represents only a subset of the total population in an area at a time, specifically only users that turned on location tracking on their mobile device. Thus, derived metrics do not represent the total population density.
- **Incomplete Coverage:** Mobility data is typically collected from sources such as mobile phone networks, GPS devices, or transportation systems. These sources may not be representative of the entire population or all economic activities, leading to sample bias and potentially inaccurate estimations.Not all individuals or businesses have access to devices or services that generate mobility data. This can result in incomplete coverage and potential underrepresentation of certain demographic groups or economic sectors.
- **Lack of Contextual Information:** Mobility data primarily captures movement patterns and geolocation information. It may lack other crucial contextual information, such as transactional data, business types, or specific economic activities, which are essential for accurate estimation of economic activity.
